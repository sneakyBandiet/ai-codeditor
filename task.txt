AI-supported lightweight code editor task
1. Overview and Goals
The goal is to create a lightweight code editor that:
    • Displays code files in a navigable file structure.
    • Includes a chat interface to interact with an AI assistant for code suggestions, debugging, and explanations.
    • Supports reading and editing files.
    • Enables internet searches to fetch additional documentation or examples.
    • Executes Python code by invoking the Python interpreter and captures runtime errors or debugging messages for further AI feedback.
    • Uses Streamlit as the framework for the user interface.
    • Provides a clear architectural plan with defined functions, classes, and their interactions.
    • Integrates system prompts and file contexts into AI prompts for complex tasks.

            ▪ Capture output, errors, and exceptions.
            ▪ Provide feedback (debugging messages, error logs) to the AI chat.
        ◦ Classes/Functions: 
            ▪ ExecutionEngine: Uses Python’s subprocess module to execute code.

            ▪ A sidebar for file navigation.
            ▪ A main pane for code display and editing.
            ▪ A dedicated chat window for AI interaction.
            ▪ An area for displaying code execution results and debugging messages.
        ◦ Classes/Functions: 
            ▪ UI functions built with Streamlit widgets (st.sidebar, st.text_area, st.button, etc.).
            ▪ Functions to update UI components based on interactions with backend modules.
3. Architectural Plan and Component Interactions
Before diving into implementation, developers should draft a small architectural diagram or plan. This plan should include:
    • Modules and Their Interactions:
        ◦ Frontend (Streamlit UI): 
            ▪ Components: File navigation sidebar, code editor pane, chat interface, output display.
            ▪ Interactions: 
                • User selects a file → UI calls FileManager to load file contents.
                • User enters a chat message → UI sends it to ChatManager, which adds system prompts (including file context if needed) via SystemPrompter.
                • User triggers code execution → UI invokes ExecutionEngine to run the code and displays output using DebugLogger.
    • Backend Modules:
        ◦ FileManager: 
            ▪ Functions: list_files(), read_file(file_path), save_file(file_path, content).
        ◦ ChatManager: 
            ▪ Functions: send_message(message), receive_response().
            ▪ Interaction: Integrates with AI services, appending system prompts and file context to user queries.
        ◦ SystemPrompter: 
            ▪ Functions: generate_prompt(user_message, file_context).
            ▪ Role: Embeds file contents or contextual information into AI prompts to enhance response accuracy.
        ◦ SearchManager: 
            ▪ Functions: perform_search(query), parse_results(raw_results).
        ◦ ExecutionEngine: 
            ▪ Functions: run_code(code), capture_output().
        ◦ DebugLogger: 
            ▪ Functions: log_error(error_message), format_debug_output(output).
    • Interaction Flow Example:
        1. File Loading: User selects a file → FileManager retrieves content → UI updates file editor.
        2. Complex Task Prompt: User requests a code enhancement → ChatManager calls SystemPrompter to create a prompt including recent file content → AI returns suggestions.
        3. Code Execution: User executes code → ExecutionEngine runs code → DebugLogger captures output → UI displays results and sends errors back to ChatManager for AI analysis.
4. System Prompts & File Context Integration
    • System Prompts:
        ◦ Define default instructions for the AI (e.g., “You are a code assistant helping to debug Python code.”).
        ◦ Allow dynamic system prompts based on the user’s current task.
        ◦ Include safety or sandboxing instructions when executing code.
    • File Context in AI Prompts:
        ◦ When users request complex tasks (e.g., code optimization or debugging), automatically include relevant file content or snippets.
        ◦ Develop a mechanism to summarize or selectively extract file context to avoid overwhelming the AI prompt.
        ◦ The SystemPrompter module should manage this context inclusion by taking parameters such as file name, recent changes, or highlighted code sections.
5. Development Milestones
    1. Project Setup:
        ◦ Initialize the project and environment.
        ◦ Set up Streamlit and install required dependencies.
    2. UI Development:
        ◦ Build the sidebar, main code editor, chat interface, and output display using Streamlit.

        ◦ Ensure that file contexts and system prompts are correctly injected into AI queries.
        ◦ Validate the complete flow from file loading → chat interaction → code execution → debugging feedback.
    5. Testing, Debugging & Documentation:
        ◦ Write tests for file operations, AI interactions, search integration, and code execution.
        ◦ Gather user feedback, document the architecture and usage, and iterate on improvements.
        ◦ Plan for secure code execution environments and sandboxing.
